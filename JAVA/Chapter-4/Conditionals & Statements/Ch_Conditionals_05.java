/*
 * When to Use Switch Case:
 * 
 * When you need to check fixed and limited values (like 1, 2, 3â€¦ or specific
 * strings).
 * 
 * When there are multiple conditions and using if-else ladder makes the code
 * long and less readable.
 * 
 * When each case requires a different action/statement to be executed.
 * 
 * When you want to improve both performance and readability.
 * 
 * Best suited for menu-driven programs, option selection, fixed input values
 * (like days, months, choices).
